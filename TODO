0. disable-enable redownloads, fix.
1. check installed-folder first when listing installs
2. enable to add/delete from vimprc
3. for vimprc-stuff, add symlink from vim/bundle/vimp
4. when symlinking, make sure we don't overwrite any existing bundles
5. if a depends on b and we delete b, then a can't work and we should
   delete (or ask or notify) that a will not work any more.

Misc
- glob-extract is completely broken
- implement gc
- remove cached download after installing
- use full package names everywhere, only use alias at the highest level

Hooking into vim:
- put vimprc in autoload, enable pathogen from here
- put rest (if anything) in bundle/vimp

Refactoring:
- refactor the code in general
- list of installs, check installed/ then check symlinks (faster, more robust)
- create an archive.py for transparently working with various archives

Packages to add
- gundo
- rainbow parenthesis

Packages to consider
- neocomplcache
- syntastic
- autoclose
- better powerline colors for nerdtree
- ack.vim
- tagbar
- see also vivify vim

Problems
- If you install powerline, then install syntastic or fugitive, you have to
run ":PowerlineClearCache" for it to work. The same goes when uninstalling
fugitive, have to clear that cache.  We need to add enable-hooks and
disable-hooks so that disabling fugitive will also run
":PowerlineClearCache" but only if powerline is installed.
